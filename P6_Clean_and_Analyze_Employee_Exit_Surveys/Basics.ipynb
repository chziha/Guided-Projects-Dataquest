    "In this project, we'll work with the datasets from exit surverys of the Department of Education, Training and Employment (DETE) and the Technical and Further Education (TAFE) institute in Queensland, Australia. We are going to answer two questions base on our study: \n",
    "1. Are employees who only worked for the institutes for a short period of time resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about employees who have been there longer?\n",
    "2. Are younger employees resigning due to some kind of dissatisfaction? What about older employees?"
