# Guided Projects for Dataquest
This repository includes all the guided projects for the [Data Scientist path at Dataquest](https://www.dataquest.io/path/data-scientist/).

## Introduction
The guided projects are representative examples of the real projects data analysts and data scientists do every day. They're designed to guide you through the process while also challenging your skills, and they're open-ended so that you can put your own twist on each project and use it for your data science portfolio.

## Installation
These projects requires Python 3.x and the installation of [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) or another software to execute the [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/). Packages required for different project may vary.
